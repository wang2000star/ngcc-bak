# RRLWR KEM NTT AVX2

This implementation uses a 32-bit NTT arithmetic path with AVX2 assembly for
the polynomial and matrix-vector kernels. The default `make` path uses the
`ring_mul_Awin_*` API: `A` is sampled into the Awin layout, transformed once,
and then multiplied with secret vectors through AVX2 row-dot kernels in
`arith/pointwise.S`.

The benchmark data below is organized from `/home/ubuntu/compare.md`. All cycle
counts are **medians**.

## Update 2026-05-31: Raw-Accumulate Awin Dot Kernels

The Awin matrix-vector dot kernels in `arith/pointwise.S` now combine the
previous KEM-specific multi-row tiling with a raw 64-bit accumulation strategy.
The old tiled kernels reduced every pointwise product immediately. The updated
kernels accumulate the even and odd 32-bit products in 64-bit lanes across the
whole dot product, then run one Montgomery reduction per output row at the end.

This keeps the existing KEM advantages:

1. K-specialized dispatch for `K=5`, `K=9`, and `K=17`.
2. Single-row fallback plus 2-row, 4-row, and 5-row tiled output kernels.
3. Reuse of each loaded secret-vector block `b[j]` across multiple output rows.

It also adopts the more efficient arithmetic shape used by the signing code:
fewer Montgomery reductions and fewer `vpmuldq` instructions in the inner dot
product. The update was verified with `KAT/KAT_KEM128`,
`KAT/KAT_KEM256`, `KAT/KAT_KEM512`, and the three functional/unit test sets.

Kernel-level effect:

1. The full Awin dot is now much cheaper: `ring_Awin_dot32(full)` changes from
   4,318 / 13,938 / 51,020 cycles to 1,632 / 3,420 / 10,590 cycles for
   RRLWR-128/256/512.
2. The improvement carries into the full keygen/encrypt-style path:
   `ring_Awin_round_xtoy_32(full)` changes from 10,034 / 24,279 / 71,460
   cycles to 7,548 / 13,754 / 30,164 cycles.
3. The `ell` path also benefits, especially at larger parameters:
   `ring_Awin_reduce_pow2_32(ell)` changes from 4,192 / 9,299 / 23,926 cycles
   to 3,717 / 6,894 / 13,993 cycles.

| `kem_decaps` | 44,369 | **40,442** | 87,790 | **73,537** | 203,073 | **148,203** |

The single-row path also uses raw accumulation, which improves the `ell=1`
RRLWR-128 decrypt-style path without hurting the larger tiled paths.

## Update 2026-05-30: Awin Sampling Breakdown

`ring_uniform_Awin` should not be read as a pure sampling kernel. It includes
three pieces of work:

1. `ring_uniform_Awin_base`: generate and unpack the sampled `A` rows into the
   Awin reversed layout.
2. `poly_ntt32` on each sampled row.
3. Awin twist preparation, i.e. precompute `(y+2) * a_i` for the later
   matrix-vector dot product.

Therefore `ring_uniform_Awin_base` is the closest RRLWR measurement to Kyber's
pure `gen_matrix` sampling cost. On the same machine, the base Awin sampler is
faster than Kyber `gen_matrix` at the comparable parameter sets:

| Parameter set | `ring_uniform_Awin_base(A)` median | Kyber `gen_matrix` median |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| RRLWR-128 vs Kyber512 | **3,904** | 6,502 |
| RRLWR-256 vs Kyber1024 | **5,842** | 26,009 |
| RRLWR-512 standalone | 11,141 | N/A |

The old `sample_Awin(A)` / `ring_uniform_Awin` row remains useful, but it
measures sampling plus NTT plus `(y+2) * a_i` precomputation, not sampling alone.

## Benchmark Notes

Build the RRLWR real AVX2 path from this directory:

```sh
make clean
make
./test/test_speed_KEM128
./test/test_speed_KEM256
./test/test_speed_KEM512
```

Build the Kyber AVX2 speed tests from `/home/ubuntu/kyber/avx2`:

```sh
make -B test/test_speed512 test/test_speed1024
./test/test_speed512
./test/test_speed1024
```

The RRLWR speed harness reports the actual default Awin kernel path. The
Kyber speed harness reports Kyber kernel names first, with the corresponding
RRLWR operation in parentheses. The mapping is operational, not identical:
Kyber uses 16-bit NTT arithmetic and RRLWR uses 32-bit NTT arithmetic.

### Compile flags

The default `Makefile` uses:

| Flag | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `-O3` | Maximum optimization |
| `-mavx2 -mbmi2 -mpopcnt` | AVX2/BMI2/popcnt code generation |
| `-march=native -mtune=native` | Tune for the local benchmark CPU |
| `-fomit-frame-pointer` | Omit frame pointers |
| `-z noexecstack` | Mark stack non-executable |

## High-Level Takeaways

On this Broadwell-EP machine, Kyber's 16-bit NTT kernels are substantially
faster than the current RRLWR 32-bit NTT kernels. RRLWR sampling is competitive
or faster for the larger `A` sampling cases, but the full matrix-vector path is
dominated by RRLWR's 32-bit NTT, inverse NTT, and Awin dot kernels.

For the current NTT AVX2 implementation, the largest remaining cycle sinks are:

| Area | Evidence from tables |
| --- | --- |
| Full Awin dot | `ring_Awin_dot32(full)` is 1,632 / 3,420 / 10,590 cycles for RRLWR-128/256/512 |
| NTT-domain conversion | `ring_ntt32(s)` scales from 2,794 to 9,231 cycles |
| Fused output path | `ring_Awin_round_xtoy_32(full)` reaches 30,164 cycles at RRLWR-512 |
| Decryption ell path | `ring_Awin_reduce_pow2_32(ell)` reaches 13,993 cycles at RRLWR-512 |

## Appendix: Kernel Operation Notes

This appendix gives a short description of the small kernels used in the
breakdown tables. The descriptions focus on what each benchmarked operation
does in the current speed harness.

### RRLWR Default AVX2 Path Status

Most RRLWR rows in the kernel tables are real default `make` operations from
the PKE/KEM call graph. A few low-level rows are microbenchmarks kept for
comparison against Kyber's primitive kernels.

| Kernel row | Default PKE/KEM path status |
| --- | --- |
| `sample` | Real composite path in keygen/encrypt. |
| `sample_Awin(A)` | Real path in keygen/encrypt through `ring_uniform_Awin`. |
| `sample_secret(s)` | Real path in keygen/encrypt through `ring_uniform`. |
| `poly_ntt32` | Real primitive, called inside Awin sampling/preparation and vector NTT paths. |
| `poly_invntt32` | Real primitive, called inside `ring_mul_Awin_invntt_*`. |
| `poly_basemul32` | Microbenchmark only for the default path; not on the current Awin PKE/KEM fast path. |
| `poly_basemul32_avx(Awin prepare)` | Real path, used by Awin twist-row preparation. |
| `poly_basemul_add32(accumulate)` | Microbenchmark/proxy only for current Awin PKE/KEM; the real fast path uses fused row-dot assembly instead of calling this symbol. |
| `poly_add32` | Microbenchmark/ref-path primitive; not on the current Awin PKE/KEM fast path. |
| `poly_add` | Microbenchmark primitive; not on the current Awin PKE/KEM fast path. |
| `poly_sub32` | Microbenchmark/ref-path primitive; not on the current Awin PKE/KEM fast path. |
| `ring_ntt32(s)` | Real path inside `ring_mul_Awin_round_xtoy_32` and `ring_mul_Awin_reduce_pow2_32`. |
| `ring_to_Awin_ncoeffs(ell)` | Real decrypt path. |
| `ring_unpack_Awin_ncoeffs(ell)` | Real encrypt path for unpacking the public-key vector into Awin form. |
| `ring_Awin_dot32(full, ntt-domain)` | Real operation. The benchmark isolates the same row-tile assembly dispatcher used inside `ring_mul_Awin_ntt_dot32`. |
| `ring_Awin_dot32(ell, ntt-domain)` | Real operation for the `ell` output path, isolated in the benchmark. |
| `ring_Awin_invntt_round_xtoy_32(full)` | Real internal stage called by `ring_Awin_round_xtoy_32`. |
| `ring_Awin_round_xtoy_32(full)` | Real keygen/encrypt matrix-vector path. |
| `ring_Awin_invntt_reduce_pow2_32(ell)` | Real encrypt second-product path when the secret vector is already in NTT domain. |
| `ring_Awin_reduce_pow2_32(ell)` | Real decrypt matrix-vector path. |

### RRLWR Kernels

| Kernel | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `sample` | Generates the public matrix input through `ring_uniform_Awin` and the secret vector through `ring_uniform`. This approximates the keygen/encrypt sampling front end. |
| `sample_Awin(A)` | Samples `A` directly into the Awin layout, runs the NTT on each base row, and prepares the `(y+2) * a_i` rows used by the Awin matrix-vector dot product. |
| `sample_secret(s)` | Samples the small secret vector `s` with coefficients in the eta range. The output is still in coefficient domain. |
| `poly_ntt32` | Runs one 32-bit forward NTT on a single polynomial. |
| `poly_invntt32` | Runs one 32-bit inverse NTT on a single polynomial and applies the final NTT constant. |
| `poly_basemul32` | Multiplies two NTT-domain polynomials coefficient-wise with 32-bit Montgomery multiplication. |
| `poly_basemul32_avx(Awin prepare)` | AVX2 base multiplication used while preparing Awin twist rows. It computes `(y+2) * a_i` in the NTT domain. |
| `poly_basemul_add32(accumulate)` | Multiplies two NTT-domain polynomials and accumulates the product into an existing output polynomial. This is the scalar building block behind row-dot accumulation. |
| `poly_add32` | Adds two polynomials with reduction modulo the NTT prime. |
| `poly_add` | Adds two polynomials without modular reduction. |
| `poly_sub32` | Subtracts two polynomials with reduction modulo the NTT prime. |
| `ring_ntt32(s)` | Applies `poly_ntt32` to every polynomial in a secret vector. This converts `s` to NTT domain before Awin dot products. |
| `ring_to_Awin_ncoeffs(ell)` | Converts a coefficient-domain ring element to Awin layout for `ell` output coefficients, including NTT and twist-row preparation. Used by decrypt-style paths. |
| `ring_unpack_Awin_ncoeffs(ell)` | Unpacks a packed public-key/ciphertext ring element into Awin layout for `ell` output coefficients, including NTT and twist-row preparation. Used by encrypt-style public-key multiplication. |
| `ring_Awin_dot32(full, ntt-domain)` | Computes the full Awin matrix-vector dot product when both `Awin` and the secret vector are already in NTT domain. This isolates the AVX2 row-dot kernels in `pointwise.S`. |
| `ring_Awin_dot32(ell, ntt-domain)` | Same as the full dot product, but only computes the `ell` output coefficients needed for the second multiplication path. |
| `ring_Awin_invntt_round_xtoy_32(full)` | Runs Awin NTT-domain dot product, inverse NTT, and fused reduce/round from `q` to `p`. The secret vector is already in NTT domain. |
| `ring_Awin_round_xtoy_32(full)` | Full keygen/encrypt-style path: NTT the secret vector, run Awin dot product, inverse NTT, and fused reduce/round from `q` to `p`. |
| `ring_Awin_invntt_reduce_pow2_32(ell)` | Runs Awin NTT-domain dot product, inverse NTT, and reduce modulo a power of two for `ell` outputs. The secret vector is already in NTT domain. |
| `ring_Awin_reduce_pow2_32(ell)` | Full decrypt/encrypt second-product style path: NTT the vector, run Awin dot product, inverse NTT, and reduce modulo a power of two for `ell` outputs. |

### Kyber Kernels

| Kernel | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `gen_matrix + poly_getnoise_eta1_4x` | Generates Kyber's public matrix with SHAKE128 rejection sampling and samples secret/noise polynomials with the 4-way eta sampler. This corresponds to RRLWR `sample`. |
| `gen_matrix` | Generates the public matrix `A` or `A^T`; output polynomials are unpacked into Kyber's NTT-friendly order. This corresponds roughly to RRLWR `sample_Awin(A)`. |
| `poly_getnoise_eta1_4x` | Four-way secret/noise sampler using SHAKE256 and CBD conversion. This corresponds to RRLWR `sample_secret(s)`. |
| `poly_ntt/ntt_avx` | Runs one Kyber 16-bit forward NTT. |
| `poly_invntt_tomont/invntt_avx` | Runs one Kyber 16-bit inverse NTT and converts to Montgomery form. |
| `poly_basemul_montgomery/basemul_avx` | Multiplies two Kyber NTT-domain polynomials with the AVX2 basemul kernel. |
| `polyvec_basemul_acc_montgomery` | Computes one vector dot product in NTT domain by repeated basemul and add. This is the closest Kyber equivalent to one RRLWR Awin row-dot output. |
| `polyvec_ntt` | Applies Kyber `poly_ntt` to every polynomial in a vector. This corresponds to RRLWR `ring_ntt32(s)`. |
| `polyvec_decompress + polyvec_ntt` | Decompresses a ciphertext vector and transforms it to NTT domain. This corresponds to a decrypt-side Awin input preparation path. |
| `polyvec_frombytes` | Loads an already serialized NTT-domain public-key/secret-key vector. This is much cheaper than RRLWR Awin unpack+NTT because Kyber serializes key polynomials in NTT representation. |
| `polyvec_basemul_acc_montgomery x K` | Computes all `K` output rows of a matrix-vector product by calling `polyvec_basemul_acc_montgomery` once per row. |
| `polyvec_basemul_acc_montgomery x 1` | Computes a single vector dot product, corresponding to an `ell`/scalar output path. |
| `poly_tomont x K` | Converts each keygen matrix-vector output into Montgomery form after the dot product. Kyber keygen includes this postscale step. |
| `polyvec_invntt_tomont` | Applies inverse NTT to every polynomial in a vector after the matrix-vector dot product. |
| `poly_invntt_tomont` | Applies inverse NTT to a single polynomial after one vector dot product. |
| `polyvec_reduce` | Barrett-reduces every coefficient in a Kyber polyvec after additions. |
| `poly_reduce` | Barrett-reduces one Kyber polynomial. |
| `polyvec_compress` | Compresses and serializes a Kyber ciphertext vector. |
| `poly_compress` | Compresses and serializes the Kyber scalar ciphertext polynomial. |
