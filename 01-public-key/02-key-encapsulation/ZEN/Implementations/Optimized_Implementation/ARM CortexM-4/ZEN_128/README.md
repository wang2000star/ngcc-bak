## Clone and Dependencies

Clone the repository through:
```bash
git clone --recursive-submodules https://github.com/JunhaoHuang/ngccm4.git
```
This repository relies on [libopencm3(@87a080c)](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/tree/87a080c94ce67643216464821c752c1c406c6414) to provide M4-related supports.

## Set-up/Installation

The makefile system requires a few host tools to be installed:

- `make`
- `python3`
- `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, `arm-none-eabi-cpp`, `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`, `arm-none-eabi-size`
- `qemu-system-arm` for `PLATFORM=mps2-an386` and `qemu-run`
- `openocd` only if you want to flash and debug on real hardware

On Ubuntu/Debian, install them with the executable helper:

```bash
./install-deps-ubuntu.sh
```

If you do not need hardware flashing, omit `openocd`:

```bash
./install-deps-ubuntu.sh --no-openocd
```

Tool purpose:

- `gcc-arm-none-eabi` and `binutils-arm-none-eabi` provide the Cortex-M4 cross compiler and binary utilities used by the makefiles.
- `python3` is needed by `libopencm3/scripts/genlink.py` during linker-script and device setup.
- `qemu-system-arm` is required only for QEMU-based runs on `mps2-an386`.
- `openocd` is optional and is only needed for flashing supported STM32 boards.

Quick verification:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
python3 --version
qemu-system-arm --version
openocd --version
```

If you do not need hardware flashing, `openocd` can be omitted.

## Manual Usage

The preferred interface is the pqm4-style output-stem target. You can build a binary directly by naming the expected output stem:

```bash
make crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test
make crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_speed
make crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_hashing
```

The generated files are:

```bash
elf/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.elf
bin/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.bin
```

The explicit selector form is still supported when needed:

```bash
make FAMILY=crypto_kem SCHEME={SCHEME_NAME} IMPLEMENTATION=ref APP=test -j1
```

## Usage for QEMU Emulation

Typical build/run examples:

```bash
make PLATFORM=mps2-an386 crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test qemu-run -j1
```


Notes:
- The QEMU build and run should be only used for correctness verification, e.g., test, testvectors. 
- Supported families in the makefile system are `crypto_kem`, `crypto_kex`, and `crypto_sign`.
- The current repository contains KEM implementations. `crypto_kex` and `crypto_sign` are already wired into the discovery/build system
- Supported hardware platforms are `nucleo-l4r5zi` (STM32L4R5ZI) and `stm32f4discovery` (STM32F407VG); `mps2-an386` is the QEMU emulation target.
- `PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi` is the default hardware build target. Pass `PLATFORM=stm32f4discovery` to build for the STM32F4DISCOVERY board.
- `-j1` means serial build mode. You can increase it, for example `-j4`, once the environment is working.

## Flashing on Real Hardware

The makefile system currently builds `.elf` and `.bin` files but does not provide a dedicated `flash` target. Use `openocd` to program the generated `.elf` file to hardware.

### Default platform: `nucleo-l4r5zi`

Build an application first:

```bash
make crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test
```

This generates:

```bash
elf/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.elf
bin/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.bin
```

Flash it with the project-local OpenOCD config:

```bash
openocd \
	-f st_nucleo_l4r5.cfg \
	-c "program elf/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.elf verify reset exit"
```

To receive the output, run `python3 hostside/host_unidirectional.py`.

Notes:

- `nucleo-l4r5zi` is the default `PLATFORM`, so you do not need to pass `PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi`.
- This expects the board to be connected through the on-board ST-Link debugger.

### Platform: `stm32f4discovery`

Build an application for the STM32F4DISCOVERY (STM32F407VG) board:

```bash
make PLATFORM=stm32f4discovery crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test
```

This generates:

```bash
elf/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.elf
bin/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.bin
```

Flash it with OpenOCD using the ST-Link interface and the STM32F4 target config:

```bash
openocd \
	-f interface/stlink.cfg \
	-f target/stm32f4x.cfg \
	-c "program elf/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.elf verify reset exit"
```

These two config files ship with OpenOCD itself (no project-local `.cfg` is
needed for this board). To flash the raw `.bin` instead, give the flash base
address:

```bash
openocd \
	-f interface/stlink.cfg \
	-f target/stm32f4x.cfg \
	-c "program bin/crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test.bin 0x08000000 verify reset exit"
```

Notes:

- This expects the board to be connected through the on-board ST-Link debugger
  (the mini-USB / ST-Link port).
- If OpenOCD reports a USB permission error, install the ST-Link udev rules
  (`contrib/60-openocd.rules` from the OpenOCD distribution) or run the command
  with `sudo`.
- The STM32F4DISCOVERY's on-board ST-Link has no virtual COM port, so serial
  output (used by `host_unidirectional.py` and `benchmark_schemes.py`) requires
  an external USB-to-UART adapter wired to `USART2` on `PA2` (TX) / `PA3` (RX)
  at 38400 baud.

### Building and Benchmarking Scripts

The repository also provides two Python helper scripts for batch builds and benchmark collection:

- `build_schemes.py`: discovers implementations for selected schemes and builds every app available in the corresponding family directory.
- `benchmark_schemes.py`: runs the `speed`, `stack`, and `hashing` apps, captures their output, and writes benchmark summaries.

Both scripts must be run from the repository root:

```bash
cd ngccm4
```

Supported platforms are:

```text
mps2-an386
nucleo-l4r5zi
stm32f4discovery
```

Other `PLATFORM` values are rejected by the scripts.

#### Batch Builds

Build every implementation and every family app for one or more schemes. Omit scheme names or use `all` to build every discovered scheme:

```bash
python3 build_schemes.py
python3 build_schemes.py all
python3 build_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...}
python3 build_schemes.py PLATFORM=stm32f4discovery {SCHEME_NAME...}
python3 build_schemes.py PLATFORM=mps2-an386 {SCHEME_NAME...}
```

Useful build options:

```bash
python3 build_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME} USE_SM3_ASM=1 USE_KECCAK=0 LTO=1 NGCC_ITERATIONS=100 -j8
```

The script searches `crypto_kem`, `crypto_kex`, and `crypto_sign`. An implementation is detected when the implementation directory contains the family entry file, for example `KEM_AlgorithmInstance.c` for KEM schemes.

#### Benchmark Runs

Run the default benchmark apps, `speed`, `stack`, and `hashing`, for all implementations of selected schemes. Omit scheme names or use `all` to benchmark every discovered scheme:

```bash
python3 benchmark_schemes.py
python3 benchmark_schemes.py all
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} --apps speed hashing
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=stm32f4discovery {SCHEME_NAME...} --apps speed hashing
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=mps2-an386 {SCHEME_NAME...} --apps speed hashing
```

Select a subset of apps with `--apps`:

```bash
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} --apps speed
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} --apps speed stack hashing
```

Forward make variables after `PLATFORM=...` as usual:

```bash
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} USE_SM3_ASM=1 USE_KECCAK=0 LTO=1 NGCC_ITERATIONS=100 -j8
```

For `mps2-an386`, the benchmark script runs each target through QEMU:

```bash
make PLATFORM=mps2-an386 <target> qemu-run
```

For `nucleo-l4r5zi`, the script builds each target, flashes it with:

```bash
openocd -f st_nucleo_l4r5.cfg -c "program <elf> verify reset exit"
```

For `stm32f4discovery`, the script builds each target and flashes it with the
OpenOCD-provided ST-Link and STM32F4 target configs:

```bash
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c "program <elf> verify reset exit"
```

Hardware benchmark output is captured from the serial port until the `#` completion marker is received. By default the script uses `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux and `/dev/tty.usbserial-0001` on macOS, at 38400 baud. Override these when needed:

```bash
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} --serial-port /dev/ttyACM1 --baud 38400
```

Benchmark outputs are written to:

```text
Out/benchmark_summary.csv
Out/benchmark_summary.md
Out/benchmark_raw/<target>.run<N>.txt
```

The CSV keeps raw metric names for post-processing. The Markdown summary is grouped by family and app. The `speed` table reports average, median, minimum, and maximum. The `stack` table reports average only. The `hashing` table reports the percentage of total operation cycles spent in hashing:

```text
average(<operation>_hash_cycles) / average(<operation>_cycles) * 100
```

Notes:

- Compare benchmark numbers only within the same platform. QEMU `mps2-an386` timings are useful for automation and regression checks, but they are not cycle-accurate hardware measurements.
- Hardware benchmark runs require `openocd`, a connected board, and a readable serial device.
- Use `--dry-run` to inspect the generated build, flash, and run commands without executing them.
- Use `--runs N` to repeat each target and aggregate samples in the summaries.


## Usage of SHA3

NGCCM4 uses SM3-based hashing and deterministic random generation by default. To build the schemes with the SHA3/SHAKE code path, pass `USE_KECCAK=1` to `make`, `build_schemes.py`, or `benchmark_schemes.py`.

When `USE_KECCAK=1` is enabled, the build system defines `USE_KECCAK` and adds the FIPS 202 implementation files from `common/`:

```text
common/fips202.c
common/fips202.h
common/keccakf1600.S
common/keccakf1600.h
common/randombytes.c
common/randombytes.h
```

This switches the guarded scheme code to the Keccak/SHA3/SHAKE implementation, including SHAKE-based XOF usage in sampling and SHA3/SHAKE-based hashing paths where the scheme code is guarded by `#ifdef USE_KECCAK`. For schemes that want to use SHA3, you need to add support for the SHA3 calls using `#ifdef USE_KECCAK` manually.

Examples:

```bash
make PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi USE_KECCAK=1 crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test
make PLATFORM=mps2-an386 USE_KECCAK=1 crypto_kem_{SCHEME_NAME}_ref_test qemu-run -j1
python3 build_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} USE_KECCAK=1
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME...} --apps speed hashing USE_KECCAK=1
```

To use the default SM3 path explicitly, pass `USE_KECCAK=0`:

```bash
python3 benchmark_schemes.py PLATFORM=nucleo-l4r5zi {SCHEME_NAME} --apps speed hashing USE_KECCAK=0
```

Notes:

- `USE_KECCAK` only accepts `0` or `1`; other values are rejected by `mk/config.mk`.
- Changing `USE_KECCAK` changes the build configuration, so the make system will clean stale `bin`, `elf`, and `obj` outputs automatically.
- `USE_SM3_ASM=1` controls the optimized SM3 assembly path. It is independent from `USE_KECCAK`.
